> Basic Course on Dough Making for Pizza, Focaccia, and Farinata Baking in Our
> Wood-Fired Oven

**Story**: Among the many activities of the 2021 quarantine, we decided to dedicate
some time to honing our skills in pizza dough preparation. With meticulous precision,
Carlo and our son Tobia embarked on a mission: crafting dough each day for an
entire week, baking it every evening in our wood-fired oven. This steadfast commitment
led us to the discovery of our favorite pizza!

In this course, you'll learn the art of handcrafting dough for pizzas, focaccias,
and farinatas. After kneading, and with the proper waiting time for rising, we'll
get ready for baking! While dough is a fundamental element in wood-fired oven
cooking, there's more to it than that. Mastering the fire in the oven and, most
importantly, managing the dishes correctly to ensure they're cooked to perfection,
are equally crucial.
