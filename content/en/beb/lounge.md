At the end of the corridor, adjoining the three bedrooms of the Bed and Breakfast,
a renovated old barn welcomes you to the communal breakfast lounge. This spacious
room, complete with a modest kitchenette, features comfortable armchairs beside
a cozy stove and board games for relaxing evenings in good company.
