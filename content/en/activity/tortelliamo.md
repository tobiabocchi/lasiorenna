> Basic Course to Learn Crafting Fresh Homemade Pasta, Tortelli, Anolini, and
> Tagliatelle Using Seasonal Produce from Our Garden

**Story**: Every family has its own recipe for creating the quintessential homemade
pasta. In our case, we've blended the recipes from our respective origins...
Fear not, no secrets are withheld! It's with joy that we share these recipes,
transforming them into a kind of legacy for the future. Just as all three of our
children developed a strong passion for cooking, flouring their little hands and
turning the pasta machine's crank, we hope the desire to try it out will also
ignite in you.

## What Do We Do? - Co Fèma?

In this course, we'll get hands-on with dough, starting with the basics of pasta
dough and progressing to the creation of various fillings. By the course's end,
you'll be adept at crafting tagliatelle, tortelli, and anolini along with their
unique fillings, following our customized and refined recipes. To facilitate the
course, we provide participants with ingredients, a recipe handbook, and the
necessary tools.

At the course's conclusion, you can choose to take your creations home or enjoy
them on-site.
