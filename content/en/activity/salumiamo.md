> Basic Course to Learn Home Charcuterie Making: Sausages, Cotechini, Salami, and
> for the More Experienced: Fiocchetti and Culatelli

**Story**: For several occasions, Carlo ventured into the impenetrable fog of
the _"Bassa"_ of Parma to uncover the secrets of the most skilled pork butchers.
He followed courses that went from butchering to pork processing. These skills were
then put to the test in our home kitchen, where our children learned to appreciate
not only the finished products but also the various stages of crafting. From a young
age, they learned to tie shoelaces and, with equal skill, to tie salami.

This training is exclusively held during the winter months, from November to
February, to take advantage of the ideal temperatures for preserving meat. At our
farmhouse, we provide the necessary equipment and ingredients for activities.
At the end of the course, you'll have the option to take your cured meats home or
"reserve" space in our cellar for aging, done by us.
