**Story**: Soap making is a simple yet precise process that demands careful
consideration of ingredients and precise measurements. My desire to produce natural
soaps and detergents stemmed from the need to use biodegradable products whenever
possible. It also arose from the necessity to repurpose beeswax, hydrosol, and
essential lavender oil that we produce, as well as wood stove ashes and sometimes
even leftover frying oil. In old recipe notebooks found at home, we even discovered
a method to make soap using lard!

## What Do We Do? - Co Fèma?

In this course, we learn how to create soap from scratch, using entirely natural
and sustainable ingredients. Once you grasp the basics, you can indulge in concocting
your unique and personalized soap recipe, tailored to your preferences for
texture, color, and fragrance.

While the saponification process doesn't take very long, the soap requires a month
to mature. Naturally, at the end of the course, you'll have the opportunity to
take your soaps home to allow them to rest before use.
