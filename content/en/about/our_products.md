On our farm, we have a **vineyard**, a **vegetable garden**, a **greenhouse**,
some **beehives**, an **orchard**, and a field dedicated to **potato cultivation**...
We are never short of work! With such abundant resources, we engage in various
processes mainly for family consumption and enjoyment.

**Grapes**: In our vineyard, we harvest Malvasia, Barbera, Bonarda, Freisa, and
Moscato grapes, producing Lambrusco, Malvasia, Rosso dei Colli, and, in recent
years, we've begun crafting a few bottles of bottle-fermented _"Spumante"_ using
the traditional method. With the reduced grape must, we also make balsamic vinegar,
which has been aging in barrels for about twenty years.

**Flowers**: Our fields are teeming with wild and cultivated flowers, and over time,
we've learned to recognize and utilize them. From St. John's Wort flowers, we
produce the distinctive red oil, excellent for soothing the skin of those who work
in the fields and for irritations. We extract essential oil and hydrosol from
Lavender, often filling the rooms of our home and B&B with its fragrance. With
Elderflower and Acacia blooms, we craft syrups for beverages and aperitifs.
Lastly, using Chamomile flowers, we prepare infusions that aid in sleep.

**Bees**: Thanks to the flowers' help, we produce excellent honey and use
beeswax for creams and soaps. Propolis is also collected and used to create a
natural antiseptic, ideal for colds and sore throats.

**Fruits and Vegetables**: With the bounty from our garden and orchard, we
prepare most of our dishes, along with jams made from sour cherries, plums,
figs, blackberries, apricots, onions, and tomato sauce.

**Pigs**: After diligently attending various courses in the region, for many
years we have been producing salami, culatello, fiocchetto, sausages, and
cotechini, all of which age in the family cellar.
