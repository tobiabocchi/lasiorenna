> Basic Course to Learn to Prepare Cakes and Sweets at Home

**Story**: For me, preparing a cake or a dessert has always been the prelude to
something wonderful on the horizon: a birthday, a friend dropping by, a milestone
to celebrate, a family gathering, and even a way to embrace magical occasions like
Christmas or Easter. Living in the countryside, I've learned to await the changing
seasons to bake apricot and blackberry cakes in the summer, apple strudel in the
fall, winter nougats, and craft flower syrups in the spring.

During the course, you'll learn to craft delightful cakes using our fresh fruit,
homemade jams, and honey. From soft-leavened cakes to cookies and traditional
holiday sweets such as Easter eggs, Christmas treats, and those for Carnival,
you'll have the opportunity to create unique delights. We'll provide each participant
with the necessary materials and ingredients for the preparation.
